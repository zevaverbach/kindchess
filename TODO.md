- [ ] create a basic DB
  - [ ] use Redis at first for the active games
    - [ ] make a list for each active game
        - [ ] key is "game_<uid>"
        - [ ] value is list of verbose moves (originating square, pieces, destination square)
    - [x] make a hash for each game
        - [x] key is "game_<uid>"
        - [x] values are key/values
            - [x] half_moves: int
            - [x] turn: 0/1
            - [x] white_can_castle_queenside
            - [x] black_can_castle_queenside
            - [x] white_can_castle_kingside
            - [x] black_can_castle_kingside
            - [x] half_moves_since_last_capture: null/moveNum
            - [x] board: probably a FEN
  - [x] use sqlite for completed games
    - [x] fields: uid and moves
    - [x] a function to store a completed game
- [ ] create a basic API
  - [ ] /game
    - [ ] GET
    - [ ] POST
        - [ ] /create
    - [ ] PUT
        - [ ] /update
            - [ ] resign
            - [ ] draw
            - [ ] abandon
            - [ ] move
- [ ] create a basic web interface
  - [ ] no user registration or chat
  - [ ] whoever creates the game is player 1
  - [ ] the second to arrive to the game is player 2
  - [ ] everyone else is a spectator
  - [ ] maybe use websockets off the bat instead of polling


# Later

- [ ] game clock
- [ ] enforce move limit (draw)
- [ ] detect cheating
