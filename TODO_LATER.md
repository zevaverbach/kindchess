- [ ] any other rules missing? there are a lot of random ones

  - it currently causes a "white abandoned the game" message which has to be ignored on the front end
- [ ] make or find more tests
    - [ ] could it ever be illegal to make the same move as a pawn when it's promoting with another piece?
        - this is how the pawn promotion move is tested once the promotion piece type is chosen
- [ ] handoff from one UI to another
- [ ] keyboard bindings
- [ ] collaborative chess
- [ ] make "private room" functionality where you can create a room and it's always available
  - [ ] allow room owner to put name tags on for both players
  - [ ] what would be cool is chess.org/myname/friendname
