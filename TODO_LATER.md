- [ ] load testing
- [ ] make or find more tests
    - [ ] could it ever be illegal to make the same move as a pawn when it's promoting with another piece?
        - this is how the pawn promotion move is tested once the promotion piece type is chosen
- [ ] reorganize code into smaller modules
- [ ] find shortcuts to limit computation and storage
  - [ ] cache possible moves for every board
    - [ ] look in this cache before trying to calculate
  - [ ] if a pawn, king, knight is sufficiently far away, no need to check whether it can put the opposing king in check
  - [ ] bitpacking?
  - [ ] persist/serialize the board differently
    - instead of FEN, maybe a hash

- [ ] game clock
- [ ] enforce move limit (draw)
- [ ] material tracking - points, pieces
- [ ] handle abandoned games
  - [ ] remove from redis, (maybe) add to db
- [ ] detect cheating
- [ ] accounts/auth
