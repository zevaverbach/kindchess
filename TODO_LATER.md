- [ ] organize code
  - [ ] core
      - [ ] pieces
      - [ ] ...
  - [ ] UIs
  - [ ] move the extra move validation out of websockets and into a separate interfaces module (not core)
    - [ ] "can't move for another player", "can't move when you're a spectator", etc.
- [ ] move history
  - [ ] make sure it gets captured even when the game moves into a buggy state
  - [ ] make a way to grab it from DB/redis and provide it to the front end
  - [ ] make a way of showing/walking through history on front end
  - [ ] make a way to walk through a bunch of pre-determined moves for testing purposes
- [ ] accounts/auth
- [ ] figure out how to get the message to actually display when being warned about abandoning a game.
- [ ] don't warn about abandoning a game if the game is over
- [ ] show what players/watchers are there
- [ ] add ethical analytics
- [ ] allow refreshing of the browser without destroying the game
- [ ] load testing
- [ ] find shortcuts to limit computation and storage
  - [ ] cache possible moves for every board
    - [ ] look in this cache before trying to calculate
  - [ ] persist/serialize the board differently
    - instead of FEN, maybe a hash

  - [ ] if a pawn, king, knight is sufficiently far away, no need to check whether it can put the opposing king in check
- [ ] game clock
- [ ] material tracking - points, pieces
- [ ] build out the site, make it look nice
  - consider using [these web components][3] for straightforward, buildless dev.
- [ ] show previous move coloring
- [ ] make or find more tests
    - [ ] could it ever be illegal to make the same move as a pawn when it's promoting with another piece?
        - this is how the pawn promotion move is tested once the promotion piece type is chosen
