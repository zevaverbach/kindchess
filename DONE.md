- [x] create a basic web API

  - [x] websockets
     - [x] there's a bug (Feb 5, 2023) where some invalid chars are sent but a) somehow this doesn't produce an error and 'continue' and b) the sender gets disconnected. Possibly I just fat-fingered this and disconnected myself, BUT the game didn't get set as "abandoned" when it happened, which points to an actual bug.
        - resolved on Feb 6, 2023 with commit c510c4f51e61c0b4a555016bf70de46056391837
     - [x] use the [websockets][1] library, at first without concerning yourself with authentication
     - [x] events
         - [x] handle abandoned games
           - [x] remove from redis, (maybe) add to db
         - [x] join
         - [x] resign
         - [x] draw
            - [x] requested
            - [x] accepted 
         - [x] move
            - [x] try stalemate
            - [x] try the fool's mate, make sure it goes
                - f2-f3, e7-e5, g2-g4, Qd8-Qh4
            - [x] on success, return to whoever's turn it is
                - [x] all possible moves
                - [x] new game state
                - [x] from/to of prev move
            - [x] don't allow someone to make a move who isn't attached to a game! (different UID)
            - [x] say "it's your turn" to whoever's turn it is, i guess as a separate message
            - [x] provide the game state to new watchers
            - [x] don't allow a websocket connection to 'join' a game if it already has joined one
            - [x] don't allow if there's only one player
            - [x] don't allow if the game is over
            - [x] don't allow a player to move out of turn
            - [x] don't allow a spectator to make a move

  - [x] mark 'winner' field of game state when there's a resignation
  - [x] update 'existing_uids' redis list as games end
  - [x] BUG: when leaving/refreshing the browser, the game gets removed but somehow remains as a link on the home screen
    - this might be because of the bullet point above
