    The following is all from ChatGPT:

- [x] Prerequisites:
        You need to have an AWS account. If you don't have one, you can create it from the AWS official website.
        Install and configure the AWS CLI on your local machine. You can find the instructions on the AWS official documentation. Make sure to configure it with the access key and secret key of your AWS account.
        You should also install the Elastic Beanstalk CLI (EB CLI), a command-line interface for Elastic Beanstalk that you can use to create, configure, and manage environments.

    Create an application:
        Go to the AWS Elastic Beanstalk console.
        Choose "Create a new application". You'll be asked for an application name, description (optional), and tags (optional).
        Click "Create".

    Create an environment:
        In your application's dashboard, click "Create a new environment".
        You'll be asked to choose a web server environment or a worker environment. Choose "web server environment" for your application.
        In the environment information section, you'll be asked for an environment name and domain. Fill those in accordingly. The domain needs to be unique across AWS.
        In the platform section, choose Python.

    Application code:
        Choose "Upload your code".
        Now you need to upload your code. The easiest way to do this is to create a ZIP file of your project, and then upload this ZIP file here.
        Note that Elastic Beanstalk requires a requirements.txt file in the root directory to install dependencies, and your application entry point should be named application.py with the Flask object named application.

    Configure more options:
        In this step, you can add an RDS DB instance, scale your application, and add notifications.
        After you're done configuring, click "Create environment".

    Upload your code:
        After your environment is set up, you can upload your code using the EB CLI. Navigate to your project directory and run eb init to initialize your Elastic Beanstalk application. You'll be prompted to select the region and the application to use. Then, use eb create to create your environment.
        To deploy a new version of your application, you can use eb deploy.

    Access your application:
        After the environment is created, you'll see a URL on the top of your dashboard. If you click this URL, you should see your application running.

    Monitoring:
        AWS Elastic Beanstalk provides monitoring and health status of your application. You can set up alarms and notifications for when something goes wrong.

Remember to terminate your environment if you're not using it to avoid unnecessary charges. You can do this in the Actions menu in your environment dashboard.

Before you get started with the deployment, you need to ensure your application is ready for production and follows the guidelines for Elastic Beanstalk Python applications. Review your application structure, ensure you have a requirements.txt file for any dependencies, and your WSGI file is properly set up.

In your case, your project is a Python chess engine based on Flask. So, it should be relatively straightforward to deploy it to Elastic Beanstalk, but make sure that your application's entry point is named application.py and the Flask object is named application.
